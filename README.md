I have analyze HR data and solve some sort of query and created a interactive dashboard using Power Bi

      2.[PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/)
 
Problesm Statement:- An organization facing problem of  Employee Attrition. Attrition stands for the departure of employees from the organization for any reason (voluntary or involuntary), including resignation, termination, death or retirement.

So the stakeholders give me the oppourtunity to make a detailed report on this problem.

Now its my responsibility to make a creative and interactive dashboard using power bi including graphs and charts to convey all the insights from the data to the stakkeholders by which it can take desccions to enconter this problem.

Now its time to create dashboard.....
